This code is part 1 of this shell project and this section I have done deals with using the fork() process.
How this will work is when you run the code it will work like a regualar shell in Linux as you the user will run your commands to move to any 
directiry or file. To test if you actually move or add a file you will want to hit cd[your next directry] then it will move you up to your next directry where you will see all other files in that directry and to make one you will press: mkdir[user inout] and it shall be created. Since this is a regular fork() process all you will need to press to run your code or file is: gcc -o [file/code name] [file/code name.c] and it will run with no issuses. Also be sure that no random user input is used because you will recieve an error saying it does not exist. Nothing more is needed for the code to run as long as it is ran in Linux and nowhere else or else erroes will pop up in the headers saying they do not work in this IDE.
